# Neural Networks

Here are the resources to understand Neural networks and Deep learning in order of preference:
1. Chapter 1 and 3 of the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" uploaded in the week 2 folder itself, note that you can skip the coding part of these chapters as the libraries we will use are different. Chapter 2 of the book is optional as it covers the internal operations of the learning algorithm. This is the best possible resource for getting started with Neural Networks. 
2. Week 4 and 5 of the course https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning (Optional) 

# TensorFlow and Keras

We will be using Keras, which is a deep learning API running on top of TensorFlow. It is relatively simple to use for basic models. 

Resources:
1. https://keras.io/guides/ 
2. https://medium.com/mlait/introduction-to-keras-deep-learning-library-2844b39f0496
3. https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/deep-learning-tutorial-with-keras-7a34a1a322cd (Implementation with imdb dataset)
4. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials (Optional)
