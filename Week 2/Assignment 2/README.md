# Digit Classification using MNIST dataset

Link for loading dataset: https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/

You have to train a Deep Neural network using Keras and TensorFlow, using the MNIST dataset. You will also test your trained model on the test data and report test error and accuracy.
Note that you are not allowed to use any convolution layers and all the layers should be fully connected. You can use regularization and suitable optimizers to boost your performance but that is optional.
25 Epochs for training should be sufficient.

The details for loading the data are given in the link provided. 

Make a Jupyter notebook and the following graphs are expected:

1. Training Error as a function of Epoch
2. Training Accuracy as a function of Epoch
3. Testing Accuracy as a function of Epoch
4. Testing Error as a function of Epoch

Also, make your code readable by commenting on what each block does, this will be helpful in the later on stages. 

A test accuracy of 95% or above is expected.
