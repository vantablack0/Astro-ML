## Linear Regression

Link for the Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who

The link provided contains the necessary information about the dataset and different variables, so go through the context and content thoroughly. Your aim will be the same as the aim given in the link. I have directly pasted the aim here for convenience: 

1. Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
2. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
3. Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
4. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
5. Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
6. Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
7. Train a linear regression model by splitting the data into Training data (80%) and Test data (20%), the target variable being Life Expectancy. You can use sklearn or code the model from scratch. Plot training error/training accuracy as a function of iterations if you are using gradient descent.

For (1) you can refer to LASSO regression which acts as a feature selector.
Note that you have to explicitly answer each question stated above, and do not refer to the code provided in the submissions of the kaggle link. 

You have to use Jupyter Notebook for writing the code and have to use suitable libraries for plotting graphs. Plots and Graphs are necessary as they are intuitive. 

Also, don't forget to comment and label your code blocks as it increases readability significantly and would help us understand the code and judge it effectively. 

## Logistic Regression

Link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

You have to train a logistic regression model on train.csv to predict whether a particular passenger survived or not, based on the variables provided. This model will then be tested on test.csv and you will have to *report* the *test accuracy* and *test error*. Note that you are free to choose metrics such as test error and also add regularization techniques if you want, it is not compulsory. Like the linear regression dataset, you can either code your model from scratch or use sklearn. 

You have to use Jupyter Notebook for writing the code and have to use suitable libraries for plotting graphs. Plots and Graphs are necessary as they are intuitive. 

Again, don't forget to comment and label your code blocks as it increases readability significantly and would help us understand the code and judge it effectively.
