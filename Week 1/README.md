## Linear Regression

Some resources to learn the intuition for Linear regression:
1. Week 1 and 2 of the course (excluding assignments) - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning (Highly recommended)
2. https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understanding-the-linear-regression-808c1f6941c0 
3. https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/a-comprehensive-guide-to-linear-regression-2994b0d71fe3 (Optional)

If you are mathematically inclined, you can read about the mathematics of Linear regression from Part 1 of 'Linear-regression.pdf' or Chapter 9 of 'Math for ML.pdf' given in the files of Week 1. 

Implementing linear regression in python:
1. https://medium.com/swlh/linear-regression-machine-learning-in-python-227f062bd07c (from scratch)
2. https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/linear-regression-in-python-with-scikit-learn-e1bb8a059cd2 (Using sklearn)
3. https://medium.com/swlh/linear-regression-9ca9f7801e81 (Optional)
4. https://medium.com/swlh/linear-regression-explained-for-beginners-in-machine-learning-9e74f168d8a8 (Optional)

You can also look up Lasso and Ridge regression online if interested which are variants of linear regression using regularization.
